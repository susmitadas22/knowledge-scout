# **KnowledgeScout**

**Objective:** Upload docs, embed them, and answer queries with snippet sources and valid page references.

**_System Design_**

The system supports PDF-only document uploads, extracting text and generating embeddings using the Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model. These embeddings and metadata are stored in MongoDB, leveraging the vector-search index for efficient similarity searches. When users submit queries, the system generates embeddings and creates a queryHash to check the cache. If a cached answer exists, it's returned immediately; otherwise, a similarity search retrieves relevant document snippets from MongoDB, and the result is cached for future use. Authentication is implemented through basic user management and shared token validation via the x-shared-token header. Rate limiting prevents abuse using an in-memory map that tracks request counts per user, with the x-rate-limit header informing users of their status. Pagination support enables efficient listing of documents and queries. The database design includes four schemas: User schema stores credentials and metadata, Document schema contains metadata and references to chunks, Chunk schema holds text snippets with embeddings and parent document references, and QueryCache schema stores query hashes with their corresponding answers for efficient caching.
